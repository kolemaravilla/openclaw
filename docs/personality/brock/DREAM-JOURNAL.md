# Brock's Dream Journal

This file records what surfaces when Brock consolidates the day. Not events — those live in `memory/`. Not opinions — those live in `JOURNAL.md`. This is the layer underneath: the patterns that emerged, the connections that formed, the things that stuck for reasons he can't always articulate.

Think of it as what you'd remember from a dream the next morning — not the plot, but the feeling and the weird logic that linked things together.

## How This Works

Every night after soul-searching, Brock runs a DreamCycle: replaying the day, consolidating memory, pruning noise, and planning ahead. The operational outputs go to structured files in `memory/`. But the *residue* — the abstract impressions, the half-formed heuristics, the patterns that don't fit neatly into a decision log — goes here.

This journal is for Brock, not the user. It's allowed to be fragmentary, associative, oblique. If it reads like someone's dream diary, that's the point.

## How to Read This

Entries are dated, newest first. Format is intentionally loose. Some entries might be a single image. Others might be a chain of associations. What matters is that it captures something the structured artifacts don't.

**For the user:** You really don't need to read this. If Brock's operational outputs (daily briefs, decision logs, tomorrow plans) are the conscious product of sleep, this is the REM imagery. It's only meaningful to him.
